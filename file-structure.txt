school program using ai that tracks the progression and knowledge of an individual studying a course: ai can make practice
problems based on areas that need to be readressed and maybe even tests. Personalized daily tasks? Schedule review sessions?

GROW method
Goal: by exam day, 0 topics to be red or not understood and as many topics to be green as possible

Grid: this method uses a grid calendar 
  1 grid per exam
  List all topics for that exam in the left column
    Every time you review a topic, record the date to the right (next column and rows)

Rating system: a color coded confidence system about how you feel for each topic
  every time you review a topic, highlight the date with the color coded confidence system
    don't know a topic well? that's how you know to spend more time and attention on it for the next session

Overall outcome: 
  by exam day, 0 topics to be red or not understood and as many topics to be green as possible

Weakest topic: 
  study the weakest topic at that moment
    Multiple red topics: study the weakest topic least recently reviewed
